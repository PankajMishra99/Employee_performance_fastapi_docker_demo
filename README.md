# Employee_performance_fastapi_docker_demo
This dataset captures daily work-from-home behavioral patterns and their relationship with employee burnout and productivity. It is designed to help analyze how factors such as working hours, screen exposure, meetings, breaks, sleep, and after-hours work collectively influence task completion efficiency and burnout risk.

The dataset consists of ~1800 daily records collected from multiple users, with each row representing a single day of work activity for a given user. Both weekdays and weekends are included to reflect realistic hybrid and flexible work schedules.

By combining objective workload metrics (work hours, screen time, meetings) with well-being indicators (sleep hours, burnout score, burnout risk), the dataset enables:

Burnout risk classification
Productivity vs well-being analysis
Behavioral pattern mining
Early burnout detection modeling
